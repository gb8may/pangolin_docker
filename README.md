Pangolin is a lightweight portable rapid development library for managing OpenGL display / interaction and abstracting video input. At its heart is a simple OpenGl viewport manager which can help to modularise 3D visualisation without adding to its complexity, and offers an advanced but intuitive 3D navigation handler. Pangolin also provides a mechanism for manipulating program variables through config files and ui integration, and has a flexible real-time plotter for visualising graphical data.
